# Weaknesses and Strengths of different vectorization strategies
- How would stemming and lemming affect software documentation data, any alternatives?
- word tokenize, character tokenize, subword tokenize?
- N-Gram, Count Vectorizing , more

# Different specific Vectorization models
- Smoothing and TF-IDF
- Different POS tags and word embedding models: NLTK, Stanford_NLP, Spacy, Glove, openNLP

# New datasets
- Find on kaggle.com or other sources
- Can be either labeled or unlabeled data

# Evaluate word embedding results
- Search evaluation methods for unsupervised learning

* Remember to cite the articles as you research
* Always try to relate to software documentation data and how it may be affected by your choice
