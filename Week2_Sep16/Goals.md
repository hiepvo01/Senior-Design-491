# Weaknesses and Strengths of different vectorization strategies
- How would stemming and lemming affect software documentation data, any alternatives to clean such special data?
- word tokenize, character tokenize, subword tokenize?
- N-Gram, Count Vectorizing , more

# Different specific Vectorization models
- Smoothing, SIF and TF-IDF: Traditional embeddings
- Different POS tags and word embedding models: NLTK, Stanford_NLP, Spacy, Glove, openNLP: Neural Network Embeddings
- How is the Neural network approaches different from traditional approaches

# New datasets
- Find on kaggle.com or other sources
- Can be either labeled or unlabeled data

# Evaluate word embedding results
- Search evaluation methods for unsupervised learning

** Remember to cite the articles as you research

** Always try to relate to software documentation data and how it may be affected by your choice
